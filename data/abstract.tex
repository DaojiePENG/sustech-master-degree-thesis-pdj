  % Quantum computing(QC) has attracted widespread attention due to its powerful computing power and potential application prospects. 
  Ion trap is one of the most promising platforms for Quantum-Computing(QC), which requires support such as electronics, optics, vacuum, measurement and control. 
  Among them, the measurement and control system(MCS) is at the core position, which connects the rest of the systems to regulate the qubits and collect results for analysis and processing, to achieve QC. 
  While traditional MCSs and those developed in earlier years are gradually becoming unfit for the increasing demand of QC.
 
  To address these new challenges, this article analyzes the practical requirements of QC based on the theoretical background of trapped ion qubit preparation and control. 
  And a strong real-time, distributed, and easily scalable Real Time Microsystem for Quantum physics(RTMQ) architecture is introduced, along with its instruction set and real-time communication link system for multiple nodes. 
  The helical resonator is an important radio frequency device in ion-QC systems. This article uses finite element technique of HFSS software combined with experiments to research on its simulation, experimentation, modeling and design. A method for designing high-Q resonators at specific frequencies and a more convenient and easy-to-use mechanical structure for the resonator is provided. 
  Based on the above foundation, a set of hardware design for the measurement and control board based on the RTMQ and some important functional peripheral FPGA firmware design are provided. 
  Combined with the actual experimental requirements related to improving the fidelity of qubit operations, the construction and testing of several key subsystems based on the RTMQ quantum MCS in the ion-QC scenario are realized, such as stabilizing of ion trap frequency, laser power and laser beatnote frequency. 
  In the process, high-speed general-purpose digital PID and IIR filters and their FPGA implementations are provided as two important peripheral extensions of the RTMQ system. 
  The above research work meets the practical needs of ion-QC, demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the constructed RTMQ quantum MCS, promotes the digitalization and integration process of ion-QC systems, and makes important preparation for future large-scale general-purpose QC in terms of MCS.
